[2025-09-23T17:41:24] User instructions:
We need a detailed remediation and validation plan for the marimo-based portfolio growth simulator project. The repository is /Users/srvo/dev/notebooks. Key assets: notebooks/portfolio_growth_simulator.py (primary interactive notebook), AGENTS.md (process log), Ethical-Capital-Brand-Kit/palette/palette.json (brand colors), docs/ (GitHub Pages outputs). Requirements from product lead: 1) ensure the portfolio growth simulator notebook works flawlessly across marimo runtime and GitHub Pages export, considering UI interactivity (Run/Reset gating, English vs Nerd modes, disclaimers, etc.). 2) Consider any other notebooks we may need to add to support diagnostics or marketing; brainstorm additions. 3) As we discover what does/doesn‚Äôt work on GitHub Pages, we must continuously add findings to AGENTS.md. 4) Stress-test all interactivity (buttons, toggles, charts, downloads) including failure paths (invalid inputs, reset flows). 5) Ask clarifying questions where needed. Provide a comprehensive plan covering investigation, fixes, testing (including marimo check, py_compile, wasm/static export verification), UX review, documentation updates, and ongoing AGENTS.md logging. Note: repo is marimo notebook style; UI controls live in dedicated cells and must avoid cross-cell collisions. Also note brand palette JSON may be missing; need fallback colors. Agents operate read-only; inspect files as needed but don‚Äôt modify.

# Agent Notes (Marimo Notebooks)

This repo contains marimo notebooks designed for public/brand‚Äëready presentation and export to GitHub Pages. Follow these conventions to keep notebooks robust, accessible, and compliant.

## Always Run Checks
- Run `uv run marimo check notebooks/` (or `marimo check notebooks/`) before handing off changes. (This avoids non-notebook Python files like tests/.)
- Fix all `critical[multiple-definitions]` issues. Variables must be unique across cells. Use underscore‚Äëprefixed locals (e.g., `_i`, `_col`, `_tmp`) for loop indices/scratch variables.
- Run a syntax check: `python3 -m py_compile <notebook>.py`.

## Marimo Coding Patterns
- Do NOT access `.value` of a UI element in the same cell that creates it. Create UI in one cell, consume values in a downstream cell.
- Avoid cross‚Äëcell name collisions. If a variable name appears in multiple cells at top level, give each cell unique names or underscore locals.
- Avoid in‚Äëplace mutation of shared arrays/dataframes across cells. Build new objects per cell.
- Keep heavy compute behind a ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button. Don‚Äôt auto‚Äësimulate on every slider change.
- Import pattern to avoid lints: top‚Äëlevel `import marimo`, then in the first cell `import marimo; mo = marimo` to provide `mo` while avoiding alias warnings.

## UI/UX Conventions
- Dual track: ‚ÄúEnglish mode (simple)‚Äù vs ‚ÄúNerd mode (detailed)‚Äù.
  - English mode shows only essential inputs: Current Value, Annual Savings, Years, Risk Level (or Custom), Years until withdrawal, and Scenario highlight.
  - Nerd mode reveals regimes, block bootstrap, distributions, log scale, band toggles, density controls, target value, etc.

**Outlining comprehensive plan for notebook inspection and testing**

I'm putting together a detailed multi-phase plan covering discovery, remediation, validation, testing, and documentation for the notebook. The plan will include running marimo checks, verifying UI elements and run gating, stress testing, logging findings, and considering extra notebooks. I‚Äôll also propose clarifying questions about the user's environment and notebook support to ensure thorough coverage.

**Drafting comprehensive remediation plan**

I'll organize a detailed plan covering investigation, remediation, testing, UX review, documentation, and ongoing steps to address disclaimers, gating, fallbacks, and brand palette consistency in the notebooks. I'll include strategies for verifying naming uniqueness with `marimo check`, stress testing toggles and downloads, and enhancing static exports for GitHub Pages. I'll also propose additional notebooks and draft a clarifying question about offline `html-wasm` export support.

Ensuring the simulator works flawlessly will take a few focused passes:

- **Current-State Recon**  
  - Review `notebooks/portfolio_growth_simulator.py` (notably the cells around disclaimers/run gating at `:918`‚Äì`:1164`) to map inputs, tokens, and download pipelines.  
  - Inspect `marimo.toml`, `docs/`, and `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to confirm export targets and Pages expectations.  
  - Open `Ethical-Capital-Brand-Kit/palette/palette.json` and enumerate required fallbacks if unavailable.

- **Gap Analysis & Remediation Tasks**  
  - Standardize disclaimer gate + Run/Reset logic: ensure `rc > rz` gating survives both live and static/Pages exports, and produce friendly guidance when interactivity is unavailable.  
  - Harden brand palette loading: wrap JSON load in try/except, introduce WCAG-compliant defaults, and thread palette throughout charts (fan, histogram, CDF, survival) with consistent `primary`/`accent` usage.  
  - Verify English vs Nerd mode segregation; relocate advanced controls into Nerd pane and keep English defaults (Student t, 3-month block bootstrap, Markov off).  
  - Audit cross-cell names and UI usage; split any cell that both creates and reads `.value`, rename locals with `_prefix` to avoid `critical[multiple-definitions]`.  
  - Add defensive validation in config assembly (allocation totals, negative amounts, withdrawal overlap) with actionable copy, and surface errors in both live and static contexts.  
  - Confirm download/export tooling uses data-URI CSV links and zip bundle with `percentiles.csv`, `final_values.csv`, `sample_paths.csv`.

- **Static Export & GitHub Pages Readiness**  
  - Generate both `html` and `html-wasm` exports via `uv run marimo export notebooks/portfolio_growth_simulator.py --format html-wasm --out docs/portfolio_growth_simulator.html`.  
  - Smoke-test exported HTML locally (open in browser, click disclaimer gate, ensure non-WASM build shows graceful ‚Äúrequires live session‚Äù messaging).  
  - Ensure `docs/index.html` (exported by workflow) properly references the simulator, master disclaimer, and any new notebooks.  
  - Document Pages-specific limitations (e.g., static Run button behavior) inside README and AGENTS.md.

- **Validation & Stress Testing**  
  - Run `uv run marimo check notebooks/` (dry-run first if linting added) and `python3 -m py_compile notebooks/portfolio_growth_simulator.py`.  
  - Launch `uvx --with numpy --with pandas --with plotly marimo run notebooks/portfolio_growth_simulator.py --log-level debug` to interactively test:  
    - Disclaimers, Run/Reset gating, English vs Nerd toggles.  
    - Boundary cases: allocations ‚â† 100%, negative savings, bridge overlapping withdrawals, extreme regimes, switching sampling methods.  
    - Download buttons produce correct data and reset clears state.  
  - Capture WASM export behavior in headless browser, validate charts render after Run, and verify scenario highlight (Conservative/Median/Optimistic) changes line styling.  
  - Confirm color contrast (use browser dev tools or automated checker) and keyboard navigation for accessibility.

- **Documentation & Logging**  
  - Append every discovery, export quirk, and remediation decision to `AGENTS.md` in chronological order while working.  
  - Update README with run commands, Pages caveats, and link to new notebooks/diagnostics; mention fallback color behavior.  
  - If diagnostics expose user-facing issues, queue follow-up work items (e.g., CLI tests) and note them in AGENTS.md.

- **Future Notebook Brainstorm**  
  - ‚ÄúMethodology Deep Dive‚Äù: explains simulations, distributions, and fee modeling for compliance reviewers.  
  - ‚ÄúMarketing Snapshot‚Äù: pre-configured scenarios with narrative copy and static charts for campaign use.  
  - ‚ÄúDiagnostics Dashboard‚Äù: internal notebook to visualize simulation performance, convergence, and runtime profiling.

Next actionable steps I can take once you‚Äôre ready: run the inspection/validation commands above, draft the remediation patches, and author the AGENTS.md updates.

One quick clarification: do we need the GitHub Pages export to support interactive (WASM) mode, or is a static read-only experience acceptable as long as we provide clear guidance to launch the live marimo app?
