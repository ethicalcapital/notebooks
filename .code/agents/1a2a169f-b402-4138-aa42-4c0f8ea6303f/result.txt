**Outlining a portfolio growth simulator plan**
[2025-09-23T17:44:55] codex

**Implementation Plan**

- Requirements Review: catalog all mandatory constraints (disclaimer gate, English/Nerd modes, run/reset gating, brand palette, Student-t default, bridge withdrawals, exports) and confirm needed data deps (palette JSON, simulation inputs).
- Notebook Skeleton: sketch cell layout for marimo file—imports/brand setup, disclaimers & acknowledgements, mode toggles, input controls (English subset vs Nerd extras), run/reset counters, and result guard rails.
- Simulation Engine: design pure functions operating on sanitized inputs (fees, distributions, regimes, block bootstrap, bridge withdrawals, run gating); ensure unique cell identifiers and no cross-cell mutations.
- Visualization & UX: plan plot generation after run trigger—fan chart, histogram, CDF, survival—applying brand palette, colorblind-safe schemes, scenario highlighting, and conditional log-scale/toggles per mode.
- Outputs & Persistence: outline data tables and data-URI download links (percentiles, final values, sample paths, zip bundle), plus reset behavior and friendly validation messages before run.
- Validation Steps: schedule `uv run marimo check notebooks/`, `python3 -m py_compile notebooks/portfolio_growth_simulator.py`, and browser-based UI inspection post-build to confirm compliance.
